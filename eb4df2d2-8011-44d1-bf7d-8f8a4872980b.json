books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world both exotic and familiar.\nThis blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling's characters.\nTheir names are often [onomatopoeic](https://bliptext.com/articles/onomatopoeic): Malfoy is difficult, Filch is unpleasant, and Lupin is a werewolf.\nHarry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses; the scholar Roni Natov terms him an \"everychild\".\nThese elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic, making him both an [everyman](https://bliptext.com/articles/everyman) and a fairytale hero.\nEach of the seven books is set over the course of one school year.\nHarry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules.\nIf students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors.\nThe stories reach their climax in the [summer term](https://bliptext.com/articles/summer-term), near or just after [final exams](https://bliptext.com/articles/final-examination), when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either [Voldemort](https://bliptext.com/articles/voldemort) or one of his followers, the [Death Eaters](https://bliptext.com/articles/death-eaters), with the stakes a matter of life and death\u2014a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books.\nIn the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor [Albus Dumbledore](https://bliptext.com/articles/albus-dumbledore).\nThe only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](https://bliptext.com/articles/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows), in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the [d\u00e9nouement](https://bliptext.com/articles/d-nouement).\n\n## Allusions\nThe Harry Potter stories feature imagery and motifs drawn from [Arthurian myth](https://bliptext.com/articles/arthurian-myth) and [fairytales](https://bliptext.com/articles/fairytales).\nHarry's ability to draw the [Sword of Gryffindor](https://bliptext.com/articles/sword-of-gryffindor) from the [Sorting Hat](https://bliptext.com/articles/sorting-hat) resembles the Arthurian [sword in the stone](https://bliptext.com/articles/excalibur) legend.\nHis life with the Dursleys has been compared to [Cinderella](https://bliptext.com/articles/cinderella).\nHogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle with several professors who belong to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a real historical person, a 14th-century scribe, Sir [Nicolas Flamel](https://bliptext.com/articles/nicolas-flamel), is described as a holder of the Philosopher's Stone.\nOther medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment and sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts, which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments, which are similar to the \"marvellous tents\" put up for knightly tournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns that exist around Hogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts.\nMany of the motifs of the Potter stories, such as the hero's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars, are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances.\nOther aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as characters, and white deer.\nThe American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th-century French Arthurian romance, Claris et Laris, writing of the \"startling\" similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris.\nArden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards.\nLike C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter also contains Christian symbolism and [allegory](https://bliptext.com/articles/allegory).\nThe series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the [psychomachia](https://bliptext.com/articles/psychomachia) tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul.\nChildren's literature critic Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and [Jesus Christ](https://bliptext.com/articles/jesus-christ).\nComparing Rowling with Lewis, she argues that \"magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality\".\nAccording to [Maria Nikolajeva](https://bliptext.com/articles/maria-nikolajeva), Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an \"[ecce homo](https://bliptext.com/articles/ecce-homo)\" speech, after which Harry is [resurrected](https://bliptext.com/articles/resurrection-of-jesus) and defeats his enemy.\nRowling stated that she did not reveal Harry Potter's religious parallels in the beginning because doing so would have \"give[n] too much away to fans who might then see the parallels\".\nIn the final book of the series, [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](https://bliptext.com/articles/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows), Rowling makes the book's Christian imagery more explicit, quoting both [Matthew 6:21](https://bliptext.com/articles/matthew-6-21) and [1 Corinthians 15:26](https://bliptext.com/articles/1-corinthians-15-26) ([King James Version](https://bliptext.com/articles/king-james-version)) when Harry visits his parents' [graves](https://bliptext.com/articles/kirkyard).\n[Hermione Granger](https://bliptext.com/articles/hermione-granger) teaches Harry Potter that the meaning of these verses from the [Christian Bible](https://bliptext.com/articles/christian-bible) are \"living beyond death. Living after death\", which Rowling states \"epitomize the whole series\".\nRowling also exhibits Christian values in developing Albus Dumbledore as a God-like character, the divine, trusted leader of the series, guiding the long-suffering hero along his quest.\nIn the seventh novel, Harry speaks with and questions the deceased Dumbledore much like a person of faith would talk to and question God.\n\n# Themes\nHarry Potter overarching theme is Comedy\nIn the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and \"a terrible sadness\" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him.\nConfronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with [Dementors](https://bliptext.com/articles/magical-creatures-in-harry-potter).\nOther characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\nThe series has an [existential](https://bliptext.com/articles/existentialism) perspective\u2014Harry must grow mature enough to accept death.\nIn Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees.\nUnlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.\nLove distinguishes Harry and Voldemort.\nHarry is a hero because he loves others, even willing to accept death to save them; Voldemort is a villain because he does not.\nHarry carries the protection of his mother's sacrifice in his blood; Voldemort, who wants Harry's blood and the protection it carries, does not understand that love vanquishes death.\nRowling has spoken about thematising death and loss in the series.\nSoon after she started writing Philosopher's Stone, her mother died; she said that \"I really think from that moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the seven books\".\nRowling has described Harry as \"the prism through which I view death\", and further stated that \"all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death\".\nWhile Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good vs. evil, its moral divisions are not absolute.\nFirst impressions of characters are often misleading.\nHarry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is on the side of good because he opposes Snape, who appears to be malicious; in reality, Quirrell is an agent of Voldemort, while Snape is loyal to Dumbledore.\nThis pattern later recurs with Moody and Snape.\nIn Rowling's world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and the possibility of redemption are key themes of the series.\nThis is reflected in Harry's self-doubts after learning his connections to Voldemort, such as Parseltongue; and prominently in Snape's characterisation, which has been described as complex and multifaceted.\nIn some scholars' view, while Rowling's narrative appears on the surface to be about Harry, her focus may actually be on Snape's morality and character arc.\nRowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems \"blindingly obvious\".\nIn the fourth book, Dumbledore speaks of a \"choice between what is right and what is easy\"; Rowling views this as a key theme, \"because that ... is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble\".\nAcademics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including [political subtexts](https://bliptext.com/articles/politics-of-harry-potter).\nThemes such as [normality](https://bliptext.com/articles/normality-behavior), oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.\nSimilarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and \"going over one's most harrowing ordeals\u2014and thus coming to terms with them\" has also been considered.\nRowling has stated that the books comprise \"a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to [bigotry](https://bliptext.com/articles/bigotry)\" and that they also pass on a message to \"question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth\".\n# [The novelist, J. K. Rowling | upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/J.///K.///Rowling///2010.jpg]\n\n# Development history\nIn 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from [Manchester](https://bliptext.com/articles/manchester) to [London](https://bliptext.com/articles/london) when the idea for Harry suddenly \"fell into\" her head.\nRowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:\n\"I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.\"\nRowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 1995 and the [manuscript](https://bliptext.com/articles/manuscript) was sent off to several prospective [agents](https://bliptext.com/articles/literary-agent).\nThe second agent she tried, [Christopher Little](https://bliptext.com/articles/christopher-little), offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to several publishers.\n\n## Publishing history\nAfter twelve other publishers had rejected Philosopher's Stone, [Bloomsbury](https://bliptext.com/articles/bloomsbury-publishing) agreed to publish the book.\nDespite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular [age group](https://bliptext.com/articles/demographic-profile) in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven.\nOn the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more [gender-neutral](https://bliptext.com/articles/epicenity) pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman.\nShe elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no [middle name](https://bliptext.com/articles/middle-name).\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 26 June 1997.\nIt was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by [Scholastic](https://bliptext.com/articles/scholastic-press)\u2014the American publisher of the books\u2014as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, after the American rights sold for US$105,000\u2014a record amount for a children's book by an unknown author.\nScholastic feared that American readers would not associate the word \"philosopher\" with magic, and Rowling suggested the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the American market.\nRowling has later said that she regrets the change.\nThe second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series, at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.\nIt was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005.\nThe seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published on 21 July 2007.\nRowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact, the epilogue) was completed \"in something like 1990\".\nRowling retained rights to digital editions and released them on the Pottermore website in 2012.\nVendors such as Amazon displayed the ebooks in the form of links to Pottermore, which controlled pricing.\nAll seven Harry Potter novels have been released in unabridged [audiobook](https://bliptext.com/articles/audiobook) versions, with [Stephen Fry](https://bliptext.com/articles/stephen-fry) reading the British editions and [Jim Dale](https://bliptext.com/articles/jim-dale) voicing the series for the American editions.\nOn [Audible](https://bliptext.com/articles/audible-service), the series has been listened, as of November 2022, for over a billion hours.\n# [The logo used in British, Australian, and Canadian editions before 2010, which uses the typeface Cochin Bold | upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Harry///Potter///wordmark///%28British%29.svg]\n\n## Translations\nThe series has been translated into more than 80 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history.\nThe books have seen translations to diverse languages such as [Korean](https://bliptext.com/articles/korean-language), [Armenian](https://bliptext.com/articles/armenian-language), [Ukrainian](https://bliptext.com/articles/ukrainian-language), [Arabic](https://bliptext.com/articles/arabic-language), [Urdu](https://bliptext.com/articles/urdu-language), [Hindi](https://bliptext.com/articles/hindi-language), [Bengali](https://bliptext.com/articles/bengali-language), [Bulgarian](https://bliptext.com/articles/bulgarian-language), [Welsh](https://bliptext.com/articles/welsh-language), [Afrikaans](https://bliptext.com/articles/afrikaans), [Albanian](https://bliptext.com/articles/albanian-language), [Latvian](https://bliptext.com/articles/latvian-language), [Vietnamese](https://bliptext.com/articles/vietnamese-language) and [Hawaiian](https://bliptext.com/articles/hawaiian-language).\nThe first volume has been translated into [Latin](https://bliptext.com/articles/latin) and even [Ancient Greek](https://bliptext.com/articles/ancient-greek), making it the longest published work in [Ancient Greek](https://bliptext.com/articles/ancient-greek) since the novels of [Heliodorus of Emesa](https://bliptext.com/articles/heliodorus-of-emesa) in the 3rd century AD. The second volume has also been translated into [Latin](https://bliptext.com/articles/latin).\nSome of the translators hired to work on the books were well-known authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as [Viktor Golyshev](https://bliptext.com/articles/viktor-golyshev), who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book.\nThe [Turkish](https://bliptext.com/articles/turkish-language) translation of books two to seven was undertaken by [Sevin Okyay](https://bliptext.com/articles/sevin-okyay), a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.\nFor reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available.\nThis led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.\nThe United States editions were adapted into [American English](https://bliptext.com/articles/american-english) to make them more understandable to a young American audience.\n# [The Russian translation of The Deathly Hallows goes on sale in Moscow, 2007 | upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/RIAN///archive///168852///The///seventh///book///about///Harry///Potter///goes///on///sale.jpg]\n\n## Cover art\nFor cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator [Thomas Taylor](https://bliptext.com/articles/thomas-taylor-artist) showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font [Cochin Bold](https://bliptext.com/articles/cochin-typeface).\nThe first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books.\nThese covers were created by first [Cliff Wright](https://bliptext.com/articles/cliff-wright-illustrator) and then Jason Cockroft.\nDue to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an 'adult' style.\nThese initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket on the cover of the final book.\nInternational and later editions have been created by a range of designers, including [Mary GrandPr\u00e9](https://bliptext.com/articles/mary-grandpr) for US audiences and [Mika Launis](https://bliptext.com/articles/mika-launis) in Finland.\nFor a later American release, [Kazu Kibuishi](https://bliptext.com/articles/kazu-kibuishi) created covers in a somewhat anime-influenced style.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Commercial success\nThe popularity of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other Harry Potter related license holders.\nThis success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author.\nThe books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular [film adaptations](https://bliptext.com/articles/film-adaptation) produced by [Warner Bros. Pictures](https://bliptext.com/articles/warner-bros-pictures), [all of which have been highly successful in their own right](https://bliptext.com/articles/list-of-highest-grossing-films).\nThe total revenue from the book sales is estimated, as of November 2018, to be around $7.7 billion.\nThe first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the bestselling books in history.\nThe films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products.\nThe Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25 billion.\nThe great demand for Harry Potter novels motivated [The New York Times](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-new-york-times) to create a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\nBy 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list.\nOn 12 April 2007, [Barnes & Noble](https://bliptext.com/articles/barnes-noble) declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its [pre-order](https://bliptext.com/articles/pre-order) record, with more than 500,000 copies [pre-order](https://bliptext.com/articles/pre-order)ed through its site.\nFor the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 [FedEx](https://bliptext.com/articles/fedex) trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book.\nTogether, Amazon.com and [Barnes & Noble](https://bliptext.com/articles/barnes-noble) pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book.\nIn the United States, the book's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies.\nThis record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5 million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8 million copies.\nWithin the first 24 hours of its release, 6.9 million copies of Prince were sold in the US; in the UK more than two million copies were sold on the first day.\nThe initial US print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.\nFans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\nThe events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours.\nThe final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first twenty-four hours of release.\nThe book sold 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.\nThe series has also gathered adult fans, leading to the release of two editions of each Harry Potter book, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults.\n# [Crowd outside a book store for the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince | upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Harry///Potter///lines.jpg]\n\n## Literary criticism\nEarly in its history, Harry Potter received positive reviews.\nOn publication, the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as [The Scotsman](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-scotsman), which said it had \"all the makings of a classic\", and [The Glasgow Herald](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-herald-glasgow), which called it \"Magic stuff\".\nSoon the English newspapers joined in, with [The Sunday Times](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-sunday-times) comparing it to [Roald Dahl](https://bliptext.com/articles/roald-dahl)'s work (\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\"), while [The Guardian](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-guardian) called it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\".\nBy the time of the release of the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars.\nYale professor, literary scholar, and critic [Harold Bloom](https://bliptext.com/articles/harold-bloom) raised criticisms of the books' literary merits, saying, \"Rowling's mind is so governed by clich\u00e9s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.\"\n[A. S. Byatt](https://bliptext.com/articles/a-s-byatt) authored an op-ed article in The New York Times calling Rowling's universe a \"secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip.\"\n[Michael Rosen](https://bliptext.com/articles/michael-rosen), a novelist and poet, held the opinion that the books were not suited for children, as they would be unable to grasp the complex themes.\nRosen also stated that \"J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer.\"\nThe critic [Anthony Holden](https://bliptext.com/articles/anthony-holden) wrote in [The Observer](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-observer) on his experience of judging [Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban](https://bliptext.com/articles/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban) for the [1999 Whitbread Awards](https://bliptext.com/articles/1999-whitbread-awards).\nHis overall view of the series was negative\u2014\"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain\", and he speaks of \"a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style\".\n[Ursula K. Le Guin](https://bliptext.com/articles/ursula-k-le-guin) said, \"I have no great opinion of it [...] it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a '[school novel](https://bliptext.com/articles/school-novel),' good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.\"\nBy contrast, author [Fay Weldon](https://bliptext.com/articles/fay-weldon), while admitting that the series is \"not what the poets hoped for\", nevertheless goes on to say, \"but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose\".\nThe literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in [The Times](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-times), stating, \"There are not many writers who have JK's [Dickensian](https://bliptext.com/articles/dickensian) ability to make us turn the pages, to weep\u2014openly, with tears splashing\u2014and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written.\"\nCharles Taylor of [Salon.com](https://bliptext.com/articles/salon-com), who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular.\nWhile he conceded that she may have \"a valid cultural point\u2014a teeny one\u2014about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art\", he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious [literary merit](https://bliptext.com/articles/literary-merit) and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers.\n[Stephen King](https://bliptext.com/articles/stephen-king) called the series \"a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable\", and declared \"Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor\" to be \"remarkable\".\nHowever, he wrote that he is \"a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle\", the formulaic beginning of all seven books.\nSameer Rahim of [The Daily Telegraph](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-daily-telegraph) disagreed, saying \"It depresses me to see 16- and 17-year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as [Oliver Twist](https://bliptext.com/articles/oliver-twist) or [A House for Mr Biswas](https://bliptext.com/articles/a-house-for-mr-biswas).\"\n[The Washington Post](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-washington-post) book critic [Ron Charles](https://bliptext.com/articles/ron-charles-critic) opined in July 2007 that \"through no fault of Rowling's\", the cultural and marketing \"hysteria\" marked by the publication of the later books \"trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide\".\nJenny Sawyer wrote in [The Christian Science Monitor](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-christian-science-monitor) on 25 July 2007 that Harry Potter neither faces a \"moral struggle\" nor undergoes any ethical growth and is thus \"no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white\".\nIn contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to [Platform 9 3/4](https://bliptext.com/articles/places-in-harry-potter) as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the [Sorting Hat](https://bliptext.com/articles/sorting-hat) as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.\nIn an 8 November 2002, [Slate](https://bliptext.com/articles/slate-magazine) article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a \"trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him\".\nIn a 12 August 2007 review of Deathly Hallows in The New York Times, however, [Christopher Hitchens](https://bliptext.com/articles/christopher-hitchens) praised Rowling for \"unmooring\" her \"English school story\" from literary precedents \"bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery\", arguing that she had instead created \"a world of youthful democracy and diversity\".\nIn 2016, an article written by [Diana C. Mutz](https://bliptext.com/articles/diana-mutz) compared the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign.\nShe suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign.\nThere is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by [Tolkien](https://bliptext.com/articles/j-r-r-tolkien)'s Lord of the Rings books.\n\n## Thematic critique\nThe portrayal of women in Harry Potter has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and [patriarchal](https://bliptext.com/articles/patriarchal) depictions of gender.\nGender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is [coeducational](https://bliptext.com/articles/mixed-sex-education) and women hold positions of power in wizarding society.\nHowever, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles.\nAccording to scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series.\nThe final three books \"showcase richer roles and more powerful females\": for instance, the series' \"most matriarchal character\", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders.\nHermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil.\nYet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and [Minerva McGonagall](https://bliptext.com/articles/minerva-mcgonagall) are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione's status as a feminist model is debated.\nGirls and women are more frequently shown as emotional, more often defined by their appearance, and less often given agency in family settings.\nThe social hierarchy of wizards in Rowling's world has drawn debate among critics.\n\"Purebloods\" have two wizard parents; \"half-bloods\" have one; and \"Muggle-born\" wizards have magical abilities, although neither of their parents is a wizard.\nLord Voldemort and his followers believe that blood purity is paramount and that Muggles are subhuman.\nAccording to the literary scholar Andrew Blake, Harry Potter rejects blood purity as a basis for social division; Suman Gupta agrees that Voldemort's philosophy represents \"absolute evil\"; and Nel and Eccleshare agree that advocates of racial or blood-based hierarchies are antagonists.\nGupta, following Blake, suggests that the essential superiority of wizards over Muggles\u2014wizards can use magic and Muggles cannot\u2014means that the books cannot coherently reject anti-Muggle prejudice by appealing to equality between wizards and Muggles.\nRather, according to Gupta, Harry Potter models a form of tolerance based on the \"charity and altruism of those belonging to superior races\" towards lesser races.\nHarry Potter's depiction of race, specifically the slavery of [house-elves](https://bliptext.com/articles/house-elves), has received varied responses.\nScholars such as [Brycchan Carey](https://bliptext.com/articles/brycchan-carey) have praised the books' [abolitionist](https://bliptext.com/articles/abolitionist) sentiments, viewing Hermione's [Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare](https://bliptext.com/articles/society-for-the-promotion-of-elfish-welfare) as a model for younger readers' political engagement.\nOther critics including [Farah Mendlesohn](https://bliptext.com/articles/farah-mendlesohn) find the portrayal of house-elves \"most difficult to accept\": the elves are denied the right to free themselves and rely on the benevolence of others like Hermione.\nPharr terms the house-elves a disharmonious element in the series, writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging; at the end of Deathly Hallows, the elves remain enslaved and cheerful.\nThe goblins of the world of Harry Potter have also received criticism for following antisemitic caricatures \u2013 particularly for their grotesque \"hook-nosed\" portrayal in the films, an appearance associated with [Jewish stereotypes](https://bliptext.com/articles/jewish-stereotypes).\n\n## Controversies\nThe books have been the subject of a number of [legal proceedings](https://bliptext.com/articles/lawsuit), stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements.\nThe popularity and high [market value](https://bliptext.com/articles/market-value) of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor [Warner Bros.](https://bliptext.com/articles/warner-bros) to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the \"Harry Potter\" [domain name](https://bliptext.com/articles/domain-name), and suing author [Nancy Stouffer](https://bliptext.com/articles/nancy-stouffer) to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work.\nVarious religious fundamentalists have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as [Wicca](https://bliptext.com/articles/wicca) and are therefore unsuitable for children,  while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas.\nThe series has landed the [American Library Associations](https://bliptext.com/articles/american-library-association)' Top 10 Banned Book List in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2019 with claims it was anti-family, discussed magic and witchcraft, contained actual spells and curses, referenced the occult/Satanism, violence, and had characters who used \"nefarious means\" to attain goals, as well as conflicts with religious viewpoints.\nThe books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds.\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the United Kingdom awards judged by children, but none of the children's book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was [intellectual snobbery](https://bliptext.com/articles/intellectual-snobbery) towards books that were popular among children.\nIn 1999, the winner of the [Whitbread Book of the Year award](https://bliptext.com/articles/whitbread-book-award) children's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, [Seamus Heaney](https://bliptext.com/articles/seamus-heaney)'s translation of the [Anglo-Saxon](https://bliptext.com/articles/anglo-saxon) epic [Beowulf](https://bliptext.com/articles/beowulf).\nIn 2000, shortly before the publication of [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire](https://bliptext.com/articles/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire), the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children's books.\nThe newspaper created a new children's section covering children's books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales.\nThe move was supported by publishers and booksellers.\nIn 2004, The New York Times further split the children's list, which was still dominated by Harry Potter books, into sections for series and individual books and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books.\nThe split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move.\n[Time](https://bliptext.com/articles/time-magazine) suggested that, on the same principle, [Billboard](https://bliptext.com/articles/billboard-magazine) should have created a separate \"[mop-tops](https://bliptext.com/articles/mop-top)\" list in 1964 when [The Beatles](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-beatles) held the top five places in its list, and [Nielsen](https://bliptext.com/articles/nielsen-media-research) should have created a separate game-show list when [Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?](https://bliptext.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire) dominated the [ratings](https://bliptext.com/articles/nielsen-ratings).\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Influence on literature\nHarry Potter transformed children's literature.\nIn the 1970s, children's books were generally [realistic](https://bliptext.com/articles/realism-arts) as opposed to fantastic, while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of [The Lord of the Rings](https://bliptext.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings).\nThe next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.\nThe commercial success of Harry Potter reversed this trend.\nThe scale of its growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years of the series' inception, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue.\nChildren's literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre.\nOlder works in the genre, including [Diana Wynne Jones](https://bliptext.com/articles/diana-wynne-jones)'s [Chrestomanci](https://bliptext.com/articles/chrestomanci) series and [Diane Duane](https://bliptext.com/articles/diane-duane)'s [Young Wizards](https://bliptext.com/articles/young-wizards), were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers.\nIn the following decades, many Harry Potter imitators and subversive responses grew popular.\nRowling has been compared to [Enid Blyton](https://bliptext.com/articles/enid-blyton), who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market.\nShe has also been described as an heir to [Roald Dahl](https://bliptext.com/articles/roald-dahl).\nSome critics view Harry Potter rise, along with the concurrent success of [Philip Pullman](https://bliptext.com/articles/philip-pullman)'s [His Dark Materials](https://bliptext.com/articles/his-dark-materials), as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure.\nThis is reflected in the BBC's 2003 \"[Big Read](https://bliptext.com/articles/big-read)\" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers 3 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top 10.\n# [Sculpture of Harry Potter in Leicester Square, London | upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Harry///Potter///sculpture///in///Leicester///Square///%2850725720988%29.jpg]\n\n## Cultural impact\nHarry Potter has been described as a cultural phenomenon.\nThe word \"Muggle\" has spread beyond its origins in the books, entering the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://bliptext.com/articles/oxford-english-dictionary) in 2003.\nA real-life version of the sport [Quidditch](https://bliptext.com/articles/quidditch-sport) was created in 2005 and featured as an exhibition tournament in the [2012 London Olympics](https://bliptext.com/articles/2012-london-olympics).\nCharacters and elements from the series have inspired [scientific names](https://bliptext.com/articles/scientific-name) of several organisms, including the dinosaur [Dracorex hogwartsia](https://bliptext.com/articles/dracorex-hogwartsia), the spider [Eriovixia gryffindori](https://bliptext.com/articles/eriovixia-gryffindori), the wasp [Ampulex dementor](https://bliptext.com/articles/ampulex-dementor), and the crab [Harryplax severus](https://bliptext.com/articles/harryplax-severus).\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books' potential to improve [literacy](https://bliptext.com/articles/literacy) by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would.\nThe seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition).\nAgreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with \"the qualities of highbrow literary fiction\", but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandise that accompanies the book launches.\nHowever, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is \"largely a folk legend\".\nResearch by the [National Endowment for the Arts](https://bliptext.com/articles/national-endowment-for-the-arts) (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books.\nThe research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres.\nNEA chairman [Dana Gioia](https://bliptext.com/articles/dana-gioia) said the series, \"got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading.\"\nMany [fan fiction](https://bliptext.com/articles/fan-fiction) and [fan art](https://bliptext.com/articles/fan-art) works about Harry Potter have been made.\nIn March 2007, \"Harry Potter\" was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject on the internet.\nJennifer Conn used Snape's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch's teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching, and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and [socialisation](https://bliptext.com/articles/socialisation); [stratification](https://bliptext.com/articles/social-stratification) and [social inequality](https://bliptext.com/articles/social-inequality); [social institutions](https://bliptext.com/articles/social-institutions); and [social theory](https://bliptext.com/articles/social-theory)\".\nFrom the early 2000s onwards, several news reports appeared in the UK of the Harry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls, and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners.\nThis led J. K. Rowling to issue several statements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls.\nDespite the media flurry, research into the popularity of Harry Potter and sales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries.\n# [\"Platform 9 3/4\" sign
